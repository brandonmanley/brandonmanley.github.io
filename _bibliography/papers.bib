    equations derived in an earlier work. These equations are derived in the double
    logarithmic approximation (summing powers of \(\alpha_s \ln^2(1/x)\, \) with \(\alpha_s\,\) the strong coupling constant and \(x\,\) the Bjorken x variable) and the large-\(N_c\,\) limit, with \(N_c\,\) the number of quark colors. From our
    solution, we extract the small-\(x\), large-\(N_c\,\) expressions of the quark and gluon OAM distributions.
    Additionally, we determine the large-\(N_c\,\) small-\(x\,\) asymptotics of the OAM distributions to be the same as obtained in the small-\(x\,\) helicity evolution, which can be
    approximated as \(\alpha_h \approx 3.66074\,\). This result is in complete agreement with the literature. Additionally,
    we calculate the ratio of the quark and gluon OAM distributions to the flavor-singlet quark and
    gluon helicity parton distribution functions respectively in the small-x region"

    abstract = "We revisit the problem of the small Bjorken-\(x\,\) asymptotics of the quark and gluon orbital angular momentum (OAM) distributions in the proton utilizing the revised small-\(x\,\) helicity evolution derived recently. We relate the quark and gluon OAM distributions at small \(x\,\) to the polarized dipole amplitudes and their (first) impact-parameter moments. To obtain the OAM distributions, we derive novel small-\(x\,\) evolution equations for the impact-parameter moments of the polarized dipole amplitudes in the double-logarithmic approximation (summing powers of \(\alpha_s \ln^2(1/x)\, \) with \(\alpha_s\,\) the strong coupling constant). We solve these evolution equations numerically and extract the leading large-\(N_c\), small-\(x\,\) asymptotics of the quark and gluon OAM distributions, which we determine to be
    in agreement with the existing results in the literature within the precision of our numerical evaluation. (Here \(N_c\,\) is the number of quark colors.) We also investigate the ratios of the quark and gluon OAM distributions to their helicity distribution counterparts in the small-\(x\,\) region."

The dataset provided by a prototype scintillator-based detector is used to characterise the performance of the detector and provide an accurate background projection. Detector designs, including a novel slab detector configuration, are considered for the data taking period of the LHC to start in 2022 (Run 3) and for the high luminosity LHC. With the Run 3 dataset, the existence of new particles with masses between 10 MeV and 45 GeV could be excluded at 95% confidence level for charges between 0.003e and 0.3e, depending on their mass.
