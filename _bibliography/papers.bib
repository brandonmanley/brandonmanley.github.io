      abstract={We revisit the problem of the small Bjorken-\(x\) asymptotics of the quark and gluon orbital angular momentum (OAM) distributions in the proton utilizing the revised formalism for small-\(x\) helicity evolution derived recently in a paper by Cougoulic, Kovchegov, Tarasov, and Tawabutr. We relate the quark and gluon OAM distributions at small \(x\) to the polarized dipole amplitudes and their (first) impact-parameter moments. To obtain the \(x\)-dependence of the OAM distributions, we derive novel small-\(x\) evolution equations for the impact-parameter moments of the polarized dipole amplitudes in the double-logarithmic approximation (summing powers of \(\alpha_s \ln(1/x) \) with \(\alpha_s\) the strong coupling constant). We solve these evolution equations numerically and extract the large-\(N_c\), small-\(x\) asymptotics of the quark and gluon OAM distributions, which we determine to be
      \( L_{q+\bar{q}}(x,Q^2) \sim L_G(x,Q^2) \sim \Delta \Sigma (x,Q^2) \sim \Delta G (x,Q^2) \sim \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)^{3.66 \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{2\pi}}} \),
      in agreement with an earlier work by Boussarie, Hatta, and Yuan within the precision of our numerical evaluation (here \(N_c\) is the number of quark colors). We also investigate the ratios of the quark and gluon OAM distributions to their helicity distribution counterparts in the small-\(x\) region.},
