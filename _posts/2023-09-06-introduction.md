## World of Kinematics

Small \(x\) physics is a weird and wonderful corner of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) that has seen constant attention since the inception of QCD. To describe the realm of small \(x\) physics, let us first discuss the canonical experimental process we associate with the variable \(x\). This process is Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS). DIS is a process where a lepton (charged or not) interacts with a baryon and produces some final state. The most common process appearing in theory is electron-proton DIS. In an quantum field theoretical description of DIS, the electron emits a virtual photon which then interacts with the proton. This process is shown in Figure ?. The resulting cross section can be completed determined with two kinematic invariants, which we label \(x\) and \(Q^2\). If \(P\) is the four-momentum of the proton and \(q\) is the four-momentum of the virtual photon, we define 
\(x = \frac{Q^2}{2P\cdot q}, \)
\(Q^2  = - q^2.\)
